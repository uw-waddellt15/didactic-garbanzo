# X-Team 38 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Discussion and google sheet


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Team members will update the google doc upon completion of their task or if they are having trouble. All team members will check the google doc to make sure we are on track.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
  Communicate regarding all individual teammate's schedules to organize the work so that deadlines
  are not missed. When one team member is exceptionally busy other team mates can communicate to cover for them.
